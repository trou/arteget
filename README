arteget is a simple ruby script that dumps television programs from the "+7" site of Arte.

It uses wget to dump streams to the disk. Be sure to have it in your PATH.

Known issues:
Note that if the program name contains accents, such as "Téléchat", your shell
should be configured in UTF-8, otherwise it won't work.

Basic usage:
1) downloading the latest broadcasts of a given program:
	$ ./arteget.rb karambolage
2) downloading a single video:
	$ ./arteget.rb http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/040347-001/le-cerveau-et-ses-automatismes-1-2
3) downloading in german, standard quality:
	$ ./arteget.rb --qual=HQ --lang=de karambolage

Protip:
You can list current program titles by using "list" as a program name.
